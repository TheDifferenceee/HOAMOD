 leaderss.5.t:0 "Death of Joseph Lyons"
 leaderss.5.desc:0 "Joseph Aloysius (Joe) Lyons was Australia's 10th Prime Minister. He was in office for 7 years, only a few days short of matching the then record term of William Hughes. He was the first Australian Prime Minister to die in office.Lyons was a very successful electoral campaigner, with wife Enid, a major factor in his winning popularity and appeal. His cautious and orthodox financial management transformed him from a dissident Labor minister to a conservative Prime Minister. His Cabinet also needed careful management. He reshuffled ministries several times and negotiated a coalition with the Country Party after the 1934 election."
 leaderss.5.a:0 "Earle Page takes his place"
 leaderss.6.t:0 "Earle Page"
 leaderss.6.desc:0 "When Lyons died suddenly in 1939, the Governor-General Lord Gowrie appointed Page as caretaker Prime Minister pending the UAP choosing a new leader. He held the office for three weeks until the UAP elected former deputy leader Robert Menzies as its new leader, and hence Prime Minister.[33] Page had been close to Lyons, but disliked Menzies, whom he charged publicly with having been disloyal to Lyons. Page contacted Stanley Bruce (now in London as Australian High Commissioner to the UK) and offered to resign his seat if Bruce would return to Australia to seek re-election to the parliament in a by-election for Page's old seat, and then seek election as UAP leader. Bruce said that he would only re-enter the parliament as an independent. When Menzies was elected UAP leader, Page refused to serve under him, and made an extraordinary personal attack on him in the House, accusing him not only of ministerial incompetence but of physical cowardice (for failing to enlist during World War I). His party soon rebelled, though, and Page was deposed as Country Party leader in favour of Archie Cameron."

 leaderss.7.desc:0 "Menzies became Prime Minister in April 1939 after Joseph Lyons' death. He held office through the early years of World War II until 1941 when he lost the confidence of members of his party and was forced to resign. As an Opposition backbencher during the war years, he helped create the Liberal Party of Australia in 1944 and became Leader of the Opposition in 1946. At the 1949 federal election, he defeated Ben Chifley’s Labor Party and once again became Australia’s Prime Minister."
